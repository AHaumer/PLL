This is a Modelica library demonstrating PLLs (phase-locked loops) resp. ATOs (angle tracking observers) for single phase and three phase electrical applications 
to synchronize control with (possibly distorted) grid voltage or the signals of a resolver indicating the rotor position. 
Some of the models are based on publications of Prof. Masoud Karimi-Ghartemani (see UsersGuide/References).
In simulation models of rotatory field machines these techniques could be used to determine rotational angular velocity of the magnetic field 
to calculate iron losses dependent on remagnetization frequency.
